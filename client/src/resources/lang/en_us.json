Evil players will often try to throw out red herrings or pin the blame on someone else.\n\n### Voting\nPlayers vote to put a player on trial, but this doesn‚Äôt always mean that player is going to be killed. The players need a majority of the votes in order to put someone onto trial. If the voting phase ends before a majority is reached, it goes directly to night after. There can be a maximum of three trials during each day.\n\n### Testimony\nThis phase comes after voting only if a player was voted onto trial. The player on trial gives their testimony while everyone else stays quiet. Usually the player on trial will claim a role and post their alibi here.\n\nIf you have been voted for a trial, don‚Äôt give up. Even if you‚Äôre evil, you can lie your way out of getting hanged.\n### Judgment\nThis phase comes after testimony. Everyone votes either innocent, or guilty. If there are more guilty votes than innocent votes, the player on trial is killed. Players can also choose to abstain. The judgement period is usually how the town gets evil players killed.\n\n### Evening\nA brief period before night. If someone was voted guilty today, this is usually where they get to say their final words.\n\nWhen there are three or less players alive, each phase is half as long as it usually is.",
