Abilities can do things such as attack players, prevent kills, or find out what role other players are.\nThe game is about communication, so townies need to share information to find the mafia as quick as possible, while mafia needs to spread misinformation to try to get townies to turn against each other to make winning easier.\n\n**MULTIPLE PLAYERS CAN HAVE THE SAME ROLE**\n\nThere are also neutral roles that have their own win conditions as described in their role wiki page.",

Some roles have abilities that allow them to communicate with others at night such as the medium, who can talk to the dead, or the mafia, who can talk with each other.\n\n### Obituary\nPlayers see who died last night, their alibi, and any death notes that were placed on the body. \n\n### Discussion\nPlayers discuss information they have to try to find out who the evil players are, or if they‚Äôre evil themselves, pretend to be a townie. Evil players will often try to throw out red herrings or pin the blame on someone else.\n\n### Nomination\nPlayers vote to put a player on trial, but this doesn‚Äôt always mean that player is going to be killed. The players need a majority of the votes in order to put someone onto trial. If the nomination phase ends before a majority is reached, it goes directly to night after. There can be a maximum of three trials during each day.\n\n### Testimony\nThis phase comes after nomination only if a player was voted onto trial. The player on trial gives their testimony while everyone else stays quiet. Usually the player on trial will claim a role and post their alibi here.\n\nIf you have been voted for a trial, don‚Äôt give up. Even if you‚Äôre evil, you can lie your way out of getting hanged.\n### Judgment\nThis phase comes after testimony. Everyone votes either innocent, or guilty. If there are more guilty votes than innocent votes, the player on trial is killed. Players can also choose to abstain. The judgement period is usually how the town gets evil players killed.\n\n### Final Words\nA brief period before night. If someone was voted guilty today, this is usually where they get to say their final words.\n\nWhen there are three or less players alive, each phase is half as long as it usually is.",
